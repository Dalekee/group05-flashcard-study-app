Flashcard Deck Import Guide
You can create and import your own decks from a plain text file. This is useful for migrating decks from other apps or for quickly creating multiple cards at once.

File Format
The app expects a simple, structured format for the text file. Each card must follow this template:

The question starts with "Q: " followed by the question text.

The answer starts with "A: " followed by the answer text.

An optional hint can follow on the next line, starting with "H: " followed by the hint text.

Each card should be separated by a blank line.

Note: The file must be saved as a plain text file with a .txt extension. The deck name will be the same as the file name.

A: Paris

Q: Who painted the Mona Lisa?
